# Configuration file for Cloudflare DDNS script
# This file contains settings for the Cloudflare API, zones, and optional features.
# Make sure to keep this file secure, especially if it contains sensitive information like API tokens.

# --- Cloudflare API Configuration ---
# Option 1: Set an environment variable (recommended for API token)
# If you set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR to a variable name (e.g., "CF_TOKEN"),
# the script will try to read the token from that environment variable.
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR = "CF_API_TOKEN" # Example, change if you use a different env var name

# Option 2: Directly set the API token here (less secure if config.py is exposed)
# This will be used if the environment variable above is not set or CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_ENV_VAR is None.
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN_HERE"

# --- Zone Configuration ---
# Add your domains and their corresponding Cloudflare Zone IDs.
# You can find the Zone ID on the "Overview" page for your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard.
ZONES = {
    "example.com": "YOUR_ZONE_ID_FOR_EXAMPLE_COM",
    # "sub.example.org": "ANOTHER_ZONE_ID",
}

# --- File Paths ---
# Relative paths are generally recommended for portability.
# These will be relative to where the script is run.
IP_FILE = "cloudflare_ddns_currentIP.txt"
LOG_FILE = "cloudflare_ddns.log"

# --- Optional Features (Discord Notifications) ---
# Enable Discord Notifications
ENABLE_DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS = False # Set to true to enable Discord notifications
DISCORD_SCRIPT_LANGAUGE = None # Set to php or py

# Discord Webhook URL for notifications. 
# !!! IMPORTANT: If you are using the PHP script, set your webhook URL in the PHP script (or .htaccess for env) instead of here.
# If you are using the Python script, set it here or in the environment variable.
# Option 1: Set an environment variable (recommended for API token)
# If you set DISCORD_API_WEBHOOK_URL_ENV_VAR to a variable name (e.g., "DISCORD_API"),
# the script will try to read the token from that environment variable.
DISCORD_API_WEBHOOK_URL_ENV_VAR = "DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_PYTHON" # Environment variable name for the webhook URL

# Option 2: Directly set the API token here (less secure if config.py is exposed)
# This will be used if the environment variable above is not set or DISCORD_API_WEBHOOK_URL_ENV_VAR is None.
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" # Example, change to your actual webhook URL

# Path to your custom script for notifications.
DISCORD_SCRIPT_PATH = None # Example: "/var/www/html/notify-ip-change.php" or "/var/www/html/send_ip_change_notification.py"

# Enable system checks (Linux specific).
# These are included in notifications if DISCORD_SCRIPT_PATH is set.
# Set to False if you are not on Linux or don't want these checks.
ENABLE_APACHE_STATUS_CHECK = False # Requires systemctl
ENABLE_SYSTEM_UPDATE_CHECK = False # Requires apt
